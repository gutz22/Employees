    "# Why are Employees leaving work?\n",
    "On this project, we're going to analyse exit surveys from the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the [Technical and Further Education (TAFE)](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) institute in Queensland, Australia. Our goal is to find out the reasons behind why these people are leaving their job."
